Go through the existing GymCore web application codebase and fix the current onboarding, routing, and feature gaps without breaking existing login and signup functionality.

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:

1. Signup Flow Fix
- The signup page currently asks for "User Type" using a dropdown.
- REMOVE user type selection from the signup form.
- Signup should only collect:
  - Full Name
  - Mobile Number
  - Email (optional)
  - City
- On successful signup:
  - Create the user
  - Set user role as NULL initially
  - Redirect the user to a new onboarding step: "Select User Type"

2. Add Select User Type Onboarding Step
- Create a new page called "Select User Type"
- Show two options as cards or buttons:
  - Gym Owner
  - Member
- User must select one option to continue

3. Role Assignment & Redirection
- If user selects "Gym Owner":
  - Update user role to OWNER
  - Redirect to a new page called "Create Gym"
- If user selects "Member":
  - Update user role to MEMBER
  - Redirect to Member Home page (Gym Discovery page)

4. Fix Incorrect Dashboard Redirection
- Currently, both members and gym owners are redirected directly to the same dashboard after signup.
- Update logic so:
  - Users with role = OWNER go to Owner Dashboard
  - Users with role = MEMBER go to Member Home
  - Users with role = NULL always go to Select User Type page

5. Create Gym Page (MISSING FEATURE)
- Create a "Create Gym" page for Gym Owners with fields:
  - Gym Name
  - Gym Address
  - City
  - Contact Number
  - Upload Gym Images (optional)
  - Upload GPay QR (optional)
  - Upload PhonePe QR (optional)
- After gym creation:
  - Redirect owner to Owner Dashboard
- Ensure a gym owner cannot access dashboard without creating at least one gym

6. Sidebar & Navigation Fix
- Sidebar currently shows:
  - Overview
  - Classes
  - Members
- Fix this as follows:
  - Remove or hide menu items for pages that do not exist yet
  - OR create placeholder pages for them with proper routing
- Sidebar items must be role-based:
  Gym Owner:
    - Overview (Dashboard)
    - Gyms
    - Members
    - Trainers
    - Attendance
    - Payments
    - Workout Plans
    - Diet Plans
    - Reports
    - Settings
  Member:
    - Dashboard
    - Workout
    - Diet
    - Attendance
    - Payments
    - Profile

7. Dashboard Data Cleanup
- The dashboard currently shows hardcoded or placeholder values:
  - Total Members
  - Active Classes
  - Monthly Revenue
- Replace placeholders with:
  - Safe default values (0, empty states)
  - Clear empty-state messages if no data exists
- Remove "Classes" and "Bookings" concepts for now unless implemented

REMAINING FEATURES TO ADD (NEXT IMPLEMENTATION):

8. Member Home (Gym Discovery)
- Create a Member Home page that:
  - Shows gyms in the user's city
  - Displays gym cards with image, name, address
  - Allows viewing gym details

9. Member & Trainer Management
- Allow gym owners to:
  - Add members using mobile number
  - Add trainers and assign them to gyms

10. Attendance Management
- Add attendance tracking:
  - Manual check-in
  - QR-based check-in (later)
- Owners can view attendance
- Members can view their attendance history

11. Payments & Fees
- Allow gym owners to track payments
- Allow members to view payment history
- Support GPay / PhonePe / Cash as payment methods

12. Workout Plans (Weekly)
- Gym owners and trainers can create workout plans
- Plans are weekly (Monday to Sunday)
- Each day supports exercises with sets and reps
- Members can only view assigned plans

13. Diet Plans (Weekly)
- Gym owners and trainers can create diet plans
- Plans are weekly with meals per day
- Some plans can be free, others paid
- Members can only view assigned plans

14. Notifications
- Gym owners can send notifications:
  - Expiry reminders
  - Offers
  - Holidays
- Members can view notifications

15. Reports
- Owner reports:
  - Monthly revenue
  - Active members

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not break existing login/signup functionality

- Show friendly empty states instead of broken UI
- Keep the UI clean and consistent with the current design
